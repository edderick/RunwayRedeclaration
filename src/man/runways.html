<h1>Runways</h1>
<p>All runways are stored as pairs or declared runways. This reflects real life where one physical strip of concrete has markings so that landings
can take place in either direction.</p>
<h2>Selecting a Physical Runway</h2>
<p>To select a physical runway, click Edit (ALT+e) and then Select Physical Runway (ALT+s). From this list select the correct Physical Runway.</p>
<h2>Selecting a Declared Runway</h2>
<p>To select a declared runway, click on the drop down box on the main window labeled Current Runway. Upon selecting a runway, all the calculations 
will immediately be updated.</p> 
<h2>Editing a Runway</h2>
<p>To edit the currently selected Physical runway, simply click Edit (ALT+e) then Physical Runway. A dialog will appear, alter the values in this
window at your leisure.</p>
<p>To edit another Physical runway, click Edit (Alt+e), then Airport (Alt+a). Next select the runway that you wish to edit from the list and click edit.
The same dialog as before will appear.</p>
<p>Runways can also be deleted this way, by clicking the Delete button instead of the Edit button.</p>
<h2>Creating a Runway</h2>
<p>If the current airport does not contain any Physical Runways, then a new runway can be created by clicking Edit (ALT+e), Physical Runway (ALt+r). 
Otherwise, a new runway can be created by opening the Edit Airport dialog, and clicking New Runway.</p>
