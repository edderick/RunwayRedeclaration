<h1>Top View</h1>
<p>The top view shows the current runway from a birds eye view. Marked on the runway are the various, different measurements. 
If an obstacle has been placed on the runway, then the measurements shown will be those of the redeclared runway.</p>
<p>The Top View is shown in the top panel by default. To show it in the bottom panel or to show it again after changing it, click View (ALT+v) then 
choose the panel to show it on, and finally click Top View.</p>
<h2>Zooming</h2>
<p>The Top View allows you to zoom in to get a clearer look at the runway. This can be done by scrolling with the mouse wheel, 
or dragging the slider in the bottom right of the panel.</p>
<h2>Dragging</h2>
<p>The View can also be dragged from side to side to pan around the runway. Simply click the mouse button, and move it while holding the button down.</p>
