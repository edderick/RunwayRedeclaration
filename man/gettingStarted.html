<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This software has been designed to be easy to use effectively and efficiently. Most functionality can be accessed through menu
items</p> 
<p>To begin redeclaring runways, you will need to load in a predefined runway, or create a new one. This can be done from the menus. 
Click on the appropriate navigation item for more information about this.</p>
<p>Next you will need to create or load an obstacle (again more information in the appropriate manual page). The addition of an obstacle to 
the runway will automatically update all of the calculations.</p>
<p>More information about the visual representations created by this software can be found elsewhere in the manual.</p>
