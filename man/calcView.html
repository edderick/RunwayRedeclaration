<h1>Calculations View</h1>
<p>The calculations view gives a textual representation of the calculations. It offers a breakdown of the calculations so
that they can be checked by hand by a qualified operator. To show the calculations view, click on the View menu (ALT+v) and then choose a panel
to display it in (ALT-t for Top Panel, Alt-b for the Bottom Panel). Finally select Calculations.</p>
<p>If you wish to fill the entire screen with the calculations, select the other panel and set it to display none.</p>
<p><strong>Note: There must be an obstacle selected for meaningful calculations to be shown</strong></p>
